# Scribbler_Project This repository is created for the Front End Group Project   # Problem Statement  Project Brief:  Till now, you have learnt about the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and fiddled around with some of the notable features of each of these languages. In the upcoming project, you would be creating a front-end of a blogging website. This blogging website will enable the user to create and publish his own articles/posts, register a new user, edit an already existing blog post, add comments on that blog post, add a "like" to any particular blog post and so on. You would be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a basic blogging website.  Goal of this project :  By creating the front-end of a blogging website, you will familiarize yourself with how usually front-end development works in a team. You will be given a set of specifications which you would be asked to meet. You will also be given screenshots of how each page on your website must look like. And towards the end of this project, you would have independently created one part each of the front-end of a blogging website!
